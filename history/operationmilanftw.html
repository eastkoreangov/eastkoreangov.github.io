<h2>Successes and Failures</h2>
<p>
The Milánists, who all suffered at least one causalty each, succeeded in getting Milán into the top 6 but not in making him the sole winner of the dodgeball game.
An unknow anti-Milánist at one point killed Milán, meaning he suffered one causalty.
However, no one won the game so it was debated whether the operation was successful or not.
In the end a vote found that most people think it was successful.
